== AuthorFilter ==
looks if any commit is authored by a user matching the given regex.
Only git is supported, projects with other VCS'es are ignored (and not included) if you use this filter!

== FnameFilter ==
looks for any file matching the given glob expression.
Useful to filter for file extensions or to check which repos are using a specific file.

examples:
# list all java projects to which I committed.
project-filter.py --author 'D.*Plaetinck' --fname '*.java' $HOME/code
# list all projects that have a remote somewhere on archlinux.org:
project-filter.py --remote archlinux\.org $HOME/code
# list all projects that use a configure script:
project-filter.py --fname 'configure' $HOME/code
